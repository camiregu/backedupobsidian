##### Question
In mathematics, instead of proving that something is true by finding it directly, we can show that it is impossible for it not to be true; this is possible and valuable because the imaginary, perfect world of mathematics allows non-constructivism to be valid.
However, in the sciences and humanities, things are much more ambiguous, vague, and impossible to measure perfectly. To what degree is non-constructivism valid here? How *useful* is it here?
