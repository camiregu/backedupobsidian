##### Question
The scientific method is founded on a basis of materialism, and that is what makes its discoveries about truth so valuable and powerful.
On the other hand, spirituality is inherently idealistic and totally contrary to materialistic ways of analyzing the world.
How can this apparent contradiction be resolved, and how have spirituality and science interacted in history?

##### Relevant Ideas
- Because of how they believed the world to be, people observed [[Galvanization and the Soul|galvanization]] and jumped to wrong conclusions about its implications on reality.
- Alessandro Volta, who [[Electric Innovations|disproved the aforementioned false theories about a life force]], [was himself a devout and adamant Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Volta#Religious_beliefs).
