##### Question
With little investigation it's easy to see all the ways North America has directly engaged in fascism, collaborated with fascism, and innovated new ways to be horribly fascist. As such, many North American historical figures have legacies stained with fascistic ideology. Yet, none of these aspects are never mentioned unless the class is dealing directly with the topic of fascism. Why is this important topic treated as irrelevant? How does this contribute to fascism's insidious spread in the present day?
