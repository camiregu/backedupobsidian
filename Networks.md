A network is present whenever there is a relationship between two or more entities along which information flows.

Networks form a substrate for social life, and humans aren't the only thing that can have a social life.

Networks leave physical traces. We can use evidence gathered in real life, phenomena observed experimentally, in order to discover what kind of networks produced them.

Complex network shapes result in complex phenomena.

Networks also provide a formal mechanism through which computation can happen - computation is inherent in the shape of the network. Particular shapes are better suited to particular tasks.

The components of a networked history are not just the technical objects, but also the assemblage.

Material agencies (i.e. tools, or things that do things) extend cognition into our things. Through the material agencies we create material reality.
