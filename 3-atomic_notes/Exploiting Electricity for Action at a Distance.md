##### Description
Scientists discover the relationship between the electric and magnetic forces, and that electricity can be used to move objects! Needles can be moved for codes, magnets can be used for filtering metal, etc.
Importantly, they also were able to make long circuits at a distance using relays! So now a needle far away could be affected almost immediately by a switch that's very close.

##### Connections
- (electric innovations)
- This technology was used to create the [[Telegraphy|electric telegraph]]!
- This also connects to the concept of [[Collapsing Space-time|collapsing space-time]], since things "at a distance" that used to take time can now be done instantly.
