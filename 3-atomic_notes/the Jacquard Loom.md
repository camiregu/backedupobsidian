##### Description
The Jacquard Loom is a type of punch card that is fitted to a loom to standardize and automate weaving patterns.

Eventually Jacques de Vaucanson, an automaton toy designer, set his attention on the loom and began the process of automating the weaving process. Then in 1804 Joseph-Marie Jacquard invented the [[the Jacquard Loom]], a one-person machine that could quickly and automatically reproduce woven patterns! This loom had a 24x speed increase and allowed for multiple machines producing identical, replicable, complex patterns all at once.

Later the drawloom was invented; more efficient than the loom but comes with its own particularities. Namely,
- 2 person set up
- slow (still faster than the loom though)
- more land devoted to thread materials (flax, mulberries, sheep)
- patterns are more able to be reproduced
- more people trained to use drawlooms

Looms are some of the oldest technology in human civilization; we've been weaving silk for a very long time. We can find evidence of humans weaving across civilizations for a long, long time.
