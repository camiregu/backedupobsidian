##### Description
The need to secure and transport information was widespread, and large empires started using ciphers to encode information safely for travel. The Caesar Shift was used by Romans, the Scytale was used by Spartans, and over time more and more advanced ciphers were created.

Eventually Francis Bacon invents the Bi-Literal cipher: a way of using 5-character strings of 'a's and 'b's to represent all of the letters in the English alphabet, specifically using a base-2 numbering system, creating the foundation for ASCII later on.
