##### Description
In fact silk was so important and useful that the Silk Road began to facilitate trade across continents, from Rome to India to China. Silk was not the only thing that travelled across these roads, including religion and culture.

It takes around 600 silk coccoons to create 1 pound of silk. It's hard to come by, it's expensive, and the process to make it is very involved. Another social process with a lot of moving parts.
