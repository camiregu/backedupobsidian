##### Description
When written language was scarce, holding the information was powerful, and it was only the powerful who had access to literacy. 
Notice that there is no natural way for information to be organized! Those who organize the information are those with power, therefore their choices reify that power and their biases.

##### Connections
From here emerged libraries: buildings designed to hold many tablets, many books, many sources of information.

There is no 'natural' way to organize materials in a library, so whoever makes that choice has power. Whoever decides what is kept in a library has power, since libraries reflect the world back onto itself.

When printing presses evolved, it changed writing a lot as anyone could be a writer and anyone could be a reader! Power dynamics changed and more people had access to writings. Yet over time, power was accumulated in the hands of the ruling class and book creation was more regulated. This parallels the start of the internet, where suddenly again way more people had access to reading and writing! And, yet again, the ruling class has standardized things and reduced us all to using the same 5 websites. (connections show)
