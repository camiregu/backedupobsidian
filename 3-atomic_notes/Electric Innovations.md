##### Description
After many experiments to discover more electrical properties, Pieter van Musschenbroek invents the first capacitor and is able to store electricity! This shocking innovation electrocutes you if you touch it.
Using the capacitor, Jean Antoine Nollet tries to measure the speed of electricity travel and finds it to be almost instantaneous.
Later, Ben Franklin proves that static electricity and lightning are really the same thing, and creates lightning rods to channel lightning and protect it from certain locations.
Then Alessandro Volta invents the battery, allowing electricity to flow and experiments to happen with constant current.
Finally, Joseph Henry creates the relay, allowing long circuits to be built.
