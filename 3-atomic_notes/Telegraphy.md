##### Description
Claude Chappe in France also develops a code to quickly send encrypted messages over distance: the visual telegraph. It was a cross piece with 4 arms that could be placed in 7 different angles, allowing it to represent 28 total symbols. The message would be duplicated by the operators from station to station so it would quickly spread through the entirety of France.

Then in 1844, Samuel Morse sends a message through electric telegraphy from Washington to Baltimore instantly through a wire; the day of visual telegraphy was over.

Like the Romans once created massive shortcuts to transport humans in the form of roads, Joseph Henry created a massive shortcut to transport information and energy through circuits.
