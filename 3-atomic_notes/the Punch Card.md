##### Description
Importantly, these machines were operated automatically using punch cards. Programmable mechanical external memory!

So Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace exploit these punch cards to enter data, output data, and store instructions.
*"We may say most aptly that the Analytical Engine weaves algebraic patterns just as the Jacquard loom weaves flowers and leaves..."* 
-Ada Lovelace
