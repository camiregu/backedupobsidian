##### Summary 
Graham argues that the mediums that carry messages can themselves impact the world, and when these mediums change, power dynamics can shift. He proves this by showing how these mediums have been controlled and changed power throughout history. This is all in order to set up a framework through which to analyze the ways the internet has changed the world.
