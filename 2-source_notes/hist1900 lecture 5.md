##### Summary
Graham argues that systems for encryption, secure communication, and decryption have been very important for societies throughout history. He proves this by showing historical examples of civilizations putting in a great deal of effort to secure communication, and showing the consequences of the failure to do that. This is all shown in order to highlight the ways in which the internet will revolutionize communication, security, and encryption.
