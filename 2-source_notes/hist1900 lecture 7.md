##### Summary
Graham argues that the history of innovation is not linear; many varied inventions interconnect in unexpected ways to create new innovations often. He proves this by taking us on a path showing how technologies related to silk, among others, eventually culminated to create computer programming. He shows this in order to highlight how the internet has deep roots in history and that its invention did not come from nothing.
