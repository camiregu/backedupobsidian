##### Description
Galvani discovered that frogs would twitch when electrically shocked, and this discovery was eventually generalized to humans and all animals. The experiments were completed mostly on corpses of criminals, since they were thought of as "lowly" dead. 
When people saw these corpses animated, they took this as evidence of the existence of a special *life force* inherent in people, and that perhaps they could even be reanimated.

##### Connections
- Volta later shows that the animation is not evidence of a life force when he invents the [[Electric Innovations|battery]].
