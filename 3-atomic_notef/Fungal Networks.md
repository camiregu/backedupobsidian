##### Description
Fungal networks are large, decentralized, and interconnected systems of mushrooms that work together to survive. The mycelium looks almost like a neural network, and like a brain, electric voltage spikes are the medium through which information is sent between the mushrooms.

##### Connections
- In [[hist1900 lecture 7|lecture 7]], Graham compared history to a fungal network! Sometimes history is conceptualized as a ladder or a direct path, when in reality it's an interconnected network of things that have happened.
- In [[hist1900 lecture 8|lecture 8]], Graham said that fungal networks were like the internet, due to their electricity-based communication and interconnectedness.
