##### Description
Cryptology is the study of systems for secret writing, and its evolution as a technology has had large impacts.
Back when most people were illiterate, all writing was encrypted! But as literacy increases, new technology has to be invented to obscure private messages.
Encryption has regularly been used to wage war, plan sneak attacks, and in general deliver information secretly.
Its inverse, decryption, has been used to catch the enemy's plans, find traitors, and eavesdrop on hidden communication.
Lives can be at stake when it comes to encrypting *and* decrypting messages, and poor cryptology can be very dangerous.
