Our culture has been heavily shaped by weaving: poems and songs have been developed to keep the beat while weaving and folklore has been written with weaving at its centre. More than just a technology, it's a social practice.

##### Connections
- This is evidence that, though in this case unintentional, technology has the ability impact an entire culture. Hence [[Control of technology is closely related to power|whoever controls the technology has the power]] to influence that impact.
- This is also evidence of how [[Impact of Mediums on Messages|mediums impact messages]]. The medium of weaving created the rhythmic nature of the messages created surrounding it, as well as the text of those messages.
