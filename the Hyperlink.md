##### Description
Hypertext is text that is linked to other text, typically through links like on Wikipedia.
In 1965 the [[the Hyperlink|hyperlink]] was created! This completely changes the way libraries connect thoughts and ideas and destroys a lot of earlier classification conventions. The bi-directional link allows us to access many connections we never could have thought of previously.

Unfortunately, the hyperlink became a mono-directional tool that only allowed the connection to go one way.
